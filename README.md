## Get Latest MLRA Raster Sample Database
The following 3 commands will download the three raster sample databases to your home directory. Adjust `destfile` paths as needed. The files should be placed in the MLRA Summary report folder. [See the detailed instructions on report setup and useage](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilReports/tree/master/inst/reports/region2/mlra-comparison).

## MLRA Similarity and Membership Model

We have developed a new approach for defining, testing, and managing MLRA and LRU concepts using multivariate signatures derived from a suite of gridded (800m) climate and soil properties. This database of signatures is constantly updated as concepts change (e.g. MLRA and LRU lines re-drawn) and evaluated for internal consistency with a supervised classification framework. Predictions generated by the supervised classification model graphically demonstrate where MLRA and LRU concepts are more or less well defined, and the level of overlap that may or may not occur at boundaries.

MLRA concept coherency as derived from a supervised classification of select MLRA signatures from the western USA. Suspected "overlap" between similar MLRA concepts (22A-5, 18-15, 21-23, etc.) can be readily evaluated using maps like this.
